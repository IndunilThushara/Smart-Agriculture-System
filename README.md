# Smart Agriculture Monitoring and Control System

### This project is not for Agricultural purporses, just for microcontroller and embedded system enthusiast.

## Overview

Welcome to the **Smart Agriculture Monitoring and Control System** repository! This project is a solution designed to monitor and manage various environmental parameters crucial for agriculture. Leveraging the power of microcontrollers, sensors, and cloud connectivity, this system ensures optimal growing conditions by automating the control of essential devices like water pumps and fans.

**Note:** This project is done to understand the low-level behavior of microcontrollers like the ATmega series. Arduino IDE or any widely used libraries aren't usedâ€”most of the functionality is hard-coded according to the relavant datasheets of the manufactures.

**Note:** The ESP32 DEVKIT V1 module is only used for send and recive the data to/from firebase cloud database. UART (Universal asynchronous receiver-transmitter) is used as the communication protocol between ESP32and ATMega MCU. There is a special ID mechanism to identify the sensor data accurately without overlapping or malfunctioning.
